Observations of stellar occultation by asteroids will make significant
impact in several areas of astronomy. Observations of these events by
professional and amateur astronomers are extremly important since
thay can provide unique information about the size of asteroids
and improve their orbit elements dramatically.

LinOccult computes predictions of such occultation of stars by asteroids.

LinOccult has been developed for Linux and distributed 
in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

GNU General Public License for more details.

To compute time and coordinates of occultation events
you need the following data:

1. DE405 - major planets ephemeris ( ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/unix ).
2. Star catalog(s) ( http://www.lunar-occultations.com/iota/occult4.htm ).
3. astorb.dat - asteroid orbits ( ftp://ftp.lowell.edu/pub/elgb/astorb.dat.gz ).

To display occultation coordinates on Earth surface you need to have
the following applicatons:

1. PovRay ( www.povray.org ).
2. EarthView ( http://earthview.sourceforge.net ).

To create pdf output you should have a TeTeX.

To install LinOccult you should get an archive file untar and ungzip it.
Then you should go to new directory and run ./allbuild or ./allbuild_sql
script. In second case you should have MySQL development package installed.
Note that by default LinOccult is statically linked. You should have static C libraries
installed or remove static flag in script.

LinOccult is a stand alone program and can be loaded by the
following command:

./linoccult <ConfigFile>

Main linoccult.config file should be placed in current directory.

Technical details:
LinOccult use DE405 precomputed major planets ephemeris to precise numerical
integration of asteroid orbit. User can select asteroids to process by
changing several parameters in configuration file.

CHANGES:
version linoccult_1.0.0beta:

1. Performance was improved 5 - 10 times by using kdtree algorithm
   in star searching procedure

2. MySQL database support was added

3. Results are stored in internal database

4. New text and pdf output format has been developed and implemented.

5. List of sites is now supported. Each site may have is own restrictions -
   minimal duration, maximal star magnitude, minimal probability and so on

6. Several bugs were fixed

7. New configuration parameters and many internal improvements were implemented

version linoccult_1.1.0:

1. Using asteroid orbit elements from Steve Preston and Jan Manek updates to 
   improve predictions accuracy.

2. To represent calculated data in user-friendly format new HTML occultations list output was developed.

3. Processing range of asteroids was added.

4. Processing stars with magnitude not more than MaxMv was added.

5. Star parallax processing was added.

6. Star coordinates and magnitude parameters were added to configuration file.

7. Asteroid brightness calculation procedure was corrected.

version LinOccult_1.1.1:

1. Support of a new astorb.dat file format with 6 digits for asteroid number was added

version LinOccult_2.0.0:

1. All libraries and application code were updated to use "pure" C++ code with namespaces, streams and STL.

2. Obsolete code was removed.

3. Vector and matrix ariphmetics, integration and Chebyshev polynomials were moved to mathematical library.

4. Structure of input/output library was changed.

5. New input/output formats were added to use in OrbSearch.

6. Two new libraries were added: APSAstroData for astronomical databases and APSAstroAlg
for astronomical algorithms.

7. Some minor bugs were fixed.

8. Calculation of preliminary events was changed.

version LinOccult_2.1.0:

1. Make files were added ( Andrew Moore ).

2. Compilation problems in Ubuntu 8.10 were fixed.

3. Output format for OccultWatcher was added.

4. Several bugs were fixed.

version LinOccult_2.1.1:

1. Bug was fixed in output to OccultWatcher.

2. Uncertainty of star position was added to asteroid uncertainty.

version LinOccult_2.2.0:

1. Migration to 64 bit platforms.

2. Some code updates to comply with modern compilers.

version LinOccult_2.3.0:

1. Gaia catalog is used instead of Tycho2.

2. Stars position calculation was improved.
